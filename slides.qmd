## Summary

-   Examine HQ Tau, intermediate mass T Tauri star undergoing magnetospheric accretion.
-   Variations in radial velocities (RV) observed in 2019-2020 cannot be solely attributed to stellar activity; a binary is one explanation.
-   Multi-output Gaussian process regression to model RVs and bisector inverse slopes (BIS).
-   Conclude that there is at least one companion; suspected brown dwarf.

## Data

-   39 polarimetric observations.
-   Collected over six months (2020 - 2021).
-   Four instruments: 
    - SPIRou
    - ESPaDOnS
    - Neo-Narval, and 
    - SOPHIE.

## Methodology

1.  Obtain high-res spectroscopy.
2.  Fit MOGP to RV and BIS.
    - No companion (without Keplerian modulation)
    - One companion (with Keplerian modulation)
    - Two companions (with Keplerian modulation)
3.  Compare the model fits
    - AICc
    - LOOCV

Used `pyaneti` package with 500 MCMC chains.

## Multi-Output GP Model

-   Mean function is Keplerian function.
-   Covariance kernel is the sum of white noise (WN) and quasi-periodic (QP) kernels.
-   Fitted to RV and BIS of LSD profiles.

$P_{GP}$ is rotation period, $\lambda_e$ stellar spot lifetime, $\lambda_p$ "wiggliness" within a period.

## Results: No companion

## Results: One companion

## Results: One companion 

- Brown dwarf companion with minimal mass of $50.1^{+29.6}_{-32.0}$ M~jup~.
- Semi-major axis of $\approx 0.61$ AU.
- Period of $126^{+32}_{-55}$ days.

## Conclusions

- There is at least one companion to HQ Tau.
- Strongly suspect a brown dwarf plus a third component.
- Need more observations outside the inflexion point of tertiary orbital motion.

## Statistical Comments

- Fitting multiple models and comparing is a good approach, but need to be guided by physics on what's plausible.
- Data missingness
    -   Moon contamination removed 2 observations in 11/2020.
    -   Dropped observations for which RV or BIS missing.
    -   Three year gap between datasets.
- Relationship between RV and BIS is only weak/moderate.
- "Multi-output" vs "multi-variate" vs "multi-dimensional" GP.
- Very informative priors were used.
